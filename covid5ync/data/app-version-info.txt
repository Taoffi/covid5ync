THANK YOU FOR USING covid5ync APPLICATION!
*******************************************
We decided to launch this project as a modest contribution in the current Covid-19 epidemic crisis.
As you know, all of us are turning to you, the biotechnology community, to help defeat this new epidemic.
With this application, we aim to offer a very modest contribution for you to do this job.

WE STRIVE TO HEAR FROM YOU TO ADD THE FEATURES MOST USEFUL FOR YOUR WORK.
Please send your feedback to covid5ync@5ync.net.. we will answer as quickly as we can.

The current (beta) version is a start point in a work in progress:
* The covid-19 DNA sequence is loaded on application startup
* You can view, zoom-in / out (using Ctrl + mouse wheel)
* You can search the sequence for nucleotides OR complementary pairs.

- sequence stats: show nucleotide percentage


We are currently preparing (future version in the coming days):

* List hairpins

At a longer term:
* Generate primers according to your settings
* ... and other features you may request!
